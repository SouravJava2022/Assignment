/*
 *  9. Write a Java program that implements a producer-consumer model using
       multithreading. The program should have a producer thread that generates random
       numbers and adds them to a queue, and a consumer thread that reads numbers
       from the queue and calculates their sum. The program should use synchronization to
       ensure that the queue is accessed by only one thread at a time.
