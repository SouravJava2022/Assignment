ğŸ’¡ **Question 2**

You have a listÂ `arr`Â of all integers in the rangeÂ `[1, n]`Â sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm onÂ `arr`:

- Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
- Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
- Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Given the integerÂ `n`, returnÂ *the last number that remains in*Â `arr`.
